  <h1>Commission Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 8, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome! Please read these Terms of Service (“Agreement”) carefully before requesting or using any commission services (“Services”) provided by Negative (“I,” “me,” or “my”). This Agreement outlines the terms and expectations for anyone requesting a commission.</p>

  <p>By requesting a commission or otherwise engaging with my Services, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to the terms, do not submit a commission request.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Services Overview</strong><br />
      I offer graphic design commissions created to the best of my ability as a junior graphic designer. Quality may vary, and results may not be polished or professional-level — this is part of my ongoing growth and experimentation.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cost and Payments</strong><br />
      At this time, all commissions are free, as I have not yet finalized a payment system.<br />
      Once payment options are available, this section will be updated to reflect prices and accepted methods.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Revisions and Communication</strong><br />
      I allow small adjustments only after the commission is delivered.<br /><br />
      I will not restart or redo the entire project once work has begun.<br /><br />
      All communication must be done through Tumblr DMs. I do not respond to commission-related messages sent to Gmail or other platforms.<br /><br />
      I do not guarantee completion of all requests, but I will do my best to complete them in a timely manner.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Prohibited Requests</strong><br />
      I will not accept commissions that involve or promote the following:
      <ul>
        <li>NSFW or explicit sexual content</li>
        <li>Harassment, abuse, hate speech, or racism</li>
        <li>Content targeting individuals or marginalized groups</li>
        <li>Anything illegal or ethically questionable</li>
        <li>Proshipping, zoophilia, pedophilia, or similar disturbing content</li>
        <li>Removal of watermarks, signatures, or credit from works by other creators</li>
      </ul>
      If your request contains or even hints at any of the above, it will be declined immediately.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Usage and Credit</strong><br />
      You are free to use your commission however you like, within the usage rights selected in the commission form.<br /><br />
      Commercial use is not permitted unless specifically approved by me.<br /><br />
      I ask that you retain the watermark if present, and/or credit me (“Negative”) in the description or post where the work appears.<br /><br />
      Credit is not legally required, but it’s respectful — and I’d really appreciate it.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cancellations</strong><br />
      If you cancel before I begin, that’s totally fine.<br /><br />
      If I have already started, I reserve the right to keep any progress and decline further changes.<br /><br />
      I may also cancel a commission at any time if you violate these terms, or if I’m unable to complete the work for any reason.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Modifications to These Terms</strong><br />
      I reserve the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date. Continued interaction with my Services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Governing Law</strong><br />
      These terms are governed by the laws applicable in the jurisdiction I reside in. Nothing fancy — just don’t be shady.
